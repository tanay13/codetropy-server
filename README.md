<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Codetropy is a set of microservice which watches over your project directory and calculates the change in the total as well as the specific file by continuously watching over the addition and deletion of characters within the project directory.

### Built With

Tools that were used in the process of making this microservice are:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://https://reactjs.org/)

### Components

- [Codetropy](https://github.com/tanay13/codetropy) - A npm package written in typescript which should be downloaded in the project directory. This package will send the changes to the server where the data will be processed accordingly.

- [Codetropy-server](https://github.com/tanay13/codetropy-server) - This is a server for codetropy written in typescript and express framework. Its main usecase is to collect data from the package and store the hashmap in the redis database.
